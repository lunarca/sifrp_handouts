                <h3>The Old Kingdom</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Lance Elmore, Duke of The Old Kingdom, Lord of Blackened Stone, Warden of the Old Kingdom</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The Old Kingdom is the northern half of the former Kingdom of Sand and Stone. It was conquered by the Kingdom of Solaris in Year 12 of the Age of Ravens. The Old Kingdom contains Blackened Stone, the former capital of the Kingdom of Sand and Stone.</p>
                    <p>Lord Lance Elmore is the current Liege of Blackened Stone. After the Conquest of Blackened Stone The Elmore Family was instated as the new rulers of The Old Kingdom. They have a mandate to quell rebellion in the remnants of the Kingdom of Sand and Stone and to provide the Old Kingdom's resources to the Realm.</p>
                    <p>Some feel that the Rule of the Elmore Family is detrimental to the Old Kingdom's best interests, and that they treat the citizens and resources unfairly while fulfilling their mandate to the Crown. Several resistance movements have risen and fallen over the years, none of which have been successful. After a new policy by Lance Elmore to draft men from The Old Kingdom into the King's Army, a new resistance movement has begun gathering more momentum than any in the past.</p>

                <h3>Westguard</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Roderick Banehill, Duke of Westguard, Lord of Five Peaks, Watcher of the Grey Wall</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>Westguard is the southern half of the former Kingdom of Sand and Stone. This region has been relatively untouched by the war, as both the only pass through the Spine of the World and the Old Kingdom's capital of Blackened Stone are in the northern region. Although it does not hold the name of the Old Kingdom, the people of Westguard are more in touch with their heritage and the history of the Kingdom of Sand and Stone than their neighbors to the North. Many of Westguard's citizens feel that even though the capital is in the North, they are the true descendants of the Old Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>Lord Roderick Banehill of Five Peaks is the descendant of the former ruling family of the Kingdom of Sand and Stone. The Banehill Family was ousted to Five Peaks after the conquest, relegated to managing the Ancient Wall. Lord Banehill rules over his people fairly, but with little in the way of management.</p>
                    <p>The Ancient Wall is the most important features of this region. It is a massive wall constructed of smooth grey stone, six miles long and fifty stories tall. Runes of ancient magics are inscribed throughout the wall's entire length. None live who know the wall's original purpose or how it was constructed. There have been no assaults against it it in written history. The only event worth noting was sixty years ago, when the runes in a segment of the wall approximately fifty feet long activated, glowing bright blue for a full day and a night. One day later, the same runes lit again in a blinding flash three times. This incident has given the wizards no end of confusion. They have been unable to determine the cause of the activity, and have not been able to manually activate the runes on that section since.</p>

                <h3>The East Range</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Falinn Underrun, Duke of the East Range, Lord of Last Reach, Warden of the East Range</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The East Range is named after the massive and active mountain range in its southern boundary. There is not much fertile land in this region, but massive cave systems in the mountains have graced the region with a thriving mining operation.</p>
                    <p>This region hosts the only major land route to and from the Old Kingdom in the form of a single large mountain pass. During the Conquest of the Old Kingdom, the city of Last Reach near the pass was used as a staging area for the invading armies. Massive fortifications were built along the pass and all throughout the region to provide a buffer area between any counterattacks and the Kingdom proper.</p>
                    <p>The East Range is strongly under the influence of the Crown. Although the East Range mountains separate this region from the core of the Kingdom, they are dependent on food imports from the Heartland to survive. Because of the only mountain pass to the Old Kingdom is in this region, the traffic brings updates of news and culture from the capital, and it is always under the watchful eye of the Crown.</p>

            <div class="region">
                <h3>Firedale</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Fenton Firebrand, Duke of Firedale, Lord of Firedale</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The Region of Firedale is named after its capital. The City of Firedale is the largest and wealthiest city in the Kingdom. The region used to be a part of the East Range, but split off after the Firebrand Family offered a great insult to Drake Underrun who was, at the time, Liege of the East Range. A quick and dirty civil war ensued, and at the end of it all the southern half of the East Range formed its own region.</p>
                    <p>Firedale has become even more prosperous than the East Range to the North. Due to its proximity to the Godsea and Solas's Tear, Firedale has become a thriving trade hub to compliment its mining industry. The city has become a thriving center of cultural exchange and innovation. The best artisans in the Kingdom and some even from beyond come to work in Firedale, and the city's Guilds have almost more power than the noble houses. Because of its nature as a center for cultural exchange, Firedale maintains its own distinct culture and relative independence from the Crown's direct control.</p>
                    <p>Nearly every culture in the Kingdom is represented in the city, and every nation beyond the Kingdom has ambassadors, artisans, and merchants. This makes the city a breeding ground for espionage. In this den of spies, the Guilds hold the most information, and influence over a Guild is the most valuable asset a spy can acquire.</p>

                <h3>Solei</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Lukas Solei, Duke of Solei, Lord of Bright Hallow, High Priest of the Burning Wheel, Defender of the Faith</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The Island of Solei is the original home of the Kingdom of Solaris. It is also the home of the Burning Wheel faith, the Kingdom's official religion. Bright Hallow, the former capitol, is the only major city on the island. It is a large walled city, with the center of the city dominated by a massive cathedral to the Burning Wheel. The other families living on the island hold small estates outside the city limits.</p>
                    <p>Solei is dominated by the Church of the Burning Wheel. Traditionally, every family sends one of its heirs to the Cathedral at Bright Hallow to join the Priesthoods of the Burning Wheel. Any family who wants to hold any political power on the island needs to maintain a strong church presence within their family, and often have priests as their liege lords.</p>
                    <p>Solei's primary role in the Kingdom is administration and record keeping. The lesser families generally also enrol one of their number in the Royal Administrators or the Bright Hallow Library. The Administrators are tasked with tax collection or city management positions when not serving in their headquarters. The Library has lesser branches in many of the other realms' capitals, and the more active members of their organization are tasked with document retrieval.</p>

                <h3>The Heartland</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Richard Marshall, Duke of the Heartland, Lord of Crossroads, Warden of the Heartland</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The Heartland and East Heartland comprise the largest area of fertile land in the Kingdom. The Heartland is also the largest region of the Kingdom. Nearly 85% of all grains eaten in the Kingdom come from the Heartland and East Heartland, as well as 60% of all other foods. Because of the Heartland's massive size, the entire region is crisscrossed by a massive road network. The King's Road is the largest road, and it runs from the Foothills all the way to the Pass in the East Range.</p>
                    <p>Crossroads is the capital of the Heartlands. It is in the intersection of the five major roads through the Heartland. The town itself is relatively small, with the castle and the sept being the town's only major permanent structures. Likewise, the permanent residents are also very few; the most common occupations are innkeeper, bartender, and blacksmith. Beyond the few permanent buildings, however, travelers pitch tents and park caravans for as far as the eye can see. Some stay for days, and some for as long as months. They trade their goods with the other travelers and resupply before moving along to their final destination.</p>
                    <p>The King's Road has always had problems with bands of roving bandits, but recently caravans have been attacked by more organized highwaymen. The largest of these groups is led by the infamous Remus Plain, the bastard brother of the region's liege, Lord Richard Marshall. Lord Marshall has issued a massive bounty on his half-brother's head, and is offering rewards for any information that helps lead to the destruction of his operation.</p>

                <h3>The East Heartland</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Taggart Carmichael, Duke of East Heartland, Lord of Port Starford</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The East Heartland was formed after Tambor Marshall claimed that the entire Heartland was too large an area for him to control on his own. The Carmichael family was elevated to Greater House status and given control over the Eastern section of the Heartland, and their holding of Port Starford was declared the region's capital. The East Heartland does much more business over water, and does a large amount of trade with the Old Kingdom and Westguard.</p>
                    <p>The Carmichael family has managed to effectively eliminate banditry as a major threat in his Region. The family has had some issues dealing with piracy against their merchant ships, but in general the East Heartland is the most stable of all of the regions in the Realm.</p>

            <div class="region">
                <h3>The Foothills</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Augustus Goddard, Duke of the Foothills, Lord of Hartward Citadel, Warden of the South</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The Foothills are the most militant region of Solaris. The entire region acts as a buffer region against the Kingdom of Winds to the south. The region has been attacked several times by the Southerners, and each time the attack has been pushed back, but at a heavy cost. To recoup the losses, the Foothills often hosts tournaments and invite knights from various lands. These tournaments act as recruiting opportunities, as well as serving to show the Crown and the rest of the Realm how well they are maintaining their border.</p>
                    <p>While there are some mountains and forests in this region, the majority of the region is hilly. Keeps and watchtowers litter the landscape, compensating for a lack of natural fortifications. Very little of the region is applied towards agriculture, instead relying on food subsidies from the East Heartland by the order of the Crown. The people of this region tend to be very rigid and disciplined, as is necessary for a military life. The Foothills are bounded on the south by a major river and a tributary system leading to the sea. They have managed to hold this line against the Kingdom of Wind for over one hundred years of constant struggle, neither being able to break past the natural border for any appreciable period of time.</p>
                    <p>While the official religion of The Foothills is The Burning Wheel, the people of the region have a strange tendency to worship the Old Gods, and in fact this is the only region east of the Spine of the World to have more than five Godswoods. Perhaps it is something about the military mind that drives them to the older and more vicious faith. Perhaps they feel that they can no longer relate to the people of the Kingdom as a whole and their religion difference is a manifestation of their division. One of the most puzzling factors is that they have had no major communication with the Old Kingdom in written history. Regardless of why it came about, the Crown and the High Septon do not approve, but they accept the people's eccentricities because of the important service they serve.</p>

                <h3>The Lunar Archipelago</h3>
                <span class="lord">Liege: Manitore Nocta, Duke of the Lunar Archipelago, Lord of The Serpent's Pass, Warden of the Seas</span>
                <span class="description">
                    <p>The Lunar Archipelago is one of this age's great mysteries. For generations, the Archipelago has been home to revolutionaries and traitors to the Realm. Five separate revolutions from five different families had to be put down by the Crown, and the Archipelago fell out of favor for many years. </p>
                    <p>However, within the past ten years the winds have started to change. Seemingly without cause, the Archipelago's families acquired a large amount of wealth. In a shocking turn of events, the King appointed Manitore Nocta Warden of the Seas instead of Lukas Solei upon Mikael Solei's death, even though all the evidence supported the Solei family maintaining the title. </p>
                    <p>As expected, allegations of corruption, blackmail, and ties to organized crime have been spinning around the rumor mill. Conjecture about the Nocta family's newfound political power is the one of the Solerian nobility's favorite topics. However, no evidence beyond conjecture has been found, and either the Nocta family is innocent, or they are extremely good at hiding it.</p>
