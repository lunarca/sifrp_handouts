			<p>The Burning Wheel is the official religion of Solaris, and the major religion to the East of the Spine of the World. The religion began on the island of Solei at the start of the Age of Flames. The religion preaches that there are two Gods: Solas, the God of the Sun, and Nox, the Goddess of the Moon. The religion claims that Solas created Man and serves as a preserving influence over them, while Nox is a corrupting influence and wants humanity to destroy itself.</p>
			<p>The religion's primary tenants are:
				<ul>
					<li>Solas, God of the Sun, Lord of Truth, and the Burning Wheel, created Humanity to rule over the world in His Name.</li>
					<li>Nox, Goddess of the Moon, Speaker of Lies, and the Lady of One Thousand Faces, is the enemy of Solas and Humanity, and she works endlessly to make Humanity destroy itself through corruption.</li>
					<li>Live with honor in the Name of the Burning Wheel. Do naught that would tarnish your name, your Family's name, or His Name.</li>
					<li>To walk with Nox is to be destroyed. Be not tempted by simple answers through dishonesty, for that way lies only disaster.</li>
					<li>There is no greater insult to the Burning Wheel than to perform treachery or dishonesty under his watchful eye. The Day is a time for truth and honor.</li> 
					<li>The followers of the Burning Wheel have a divine mandate to spread His Word across Land and Ocean to ensure Nox gains no foothold in this world.</li>
				</ul>
				These tenants are drawn from the religion's primary holy work, "To Walk the Path," written by the First Prophet Tessin Solei at the start of the Age of Fire.</p>
				<p>The religion is fairly direct and simple. However, certain complications have arose due to them. For instance, the "Divine Mandate to Spread His Word" caused the Island of Solei to begin spreading its influence and conquer everything in its path. Many Septons believe that silver is where the first beams of moonlight touched iron, and claim it is corrupted by Nox. Because of this, silver is worthless in any city with a strong Burning Wheel contingent. </p>
