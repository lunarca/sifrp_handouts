	<h2>Politics</h2>

		<div class="th">Structure</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p>The Kingdom of Solaris uses the Feudal System. The King at the current time is Maxwell du Solas, a descendant of the First Prophet Tessin Solei and Ezekiel du Solas the Conqueror. The du Solas family lives on the Kingdom's Capital, the Tear of Solas, the island in the center of the Godsea.</p>
			<p>Beneath the du Solas family are the Great Houses. These families swear oaths of fealty to the Crown in exchange for rule over one of the Regions of the Kingdom. Beneath them are the lesser Houses, who swear fealty to the Greater Houses or other Lesser Houses for grants of land, power, and  noble titles.</p>

		<div class="th">Current Political Climate</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p>The current political climate of Solaris is more tense than it has been in an age. There have been several decades of peace in the Realm during which grudges and feuds have been quietly developing. Many Maesters believe that the only thing keeping the Kingdom together at the moment is the inertia of an age of peace. None want to be the first to wage war, but once it begins, the Realm will be in grave danger.</p>
			<p>There are several lines of tension throughout the Kingdom. 
				<ul>
					<li>The Old Kingdom is a major source of trouble. House Elmore was instated as the rulers of The Old Kingdom after Solaris conquered the Kingdom of Sand and Stone. They tend to support the Crown over the people they protect, and there is significant unrest between them. There is talk of overthrowing the oppressive rule of House Elmore and separating from the Realm. In addition to this, House Banehill of Westguard was the former royal family of the Kingdom of Sand and Stone, and they lost their holdings after they were defeated. If given the opportunity, some fringe elements of House Banehill would happily attempt to recapture Blackened Stone.</li>
					<li>House Nocta was elevated to the status of Great House five years before the start of the game, and since then they managed to bring the Lunar Archipelago out of the King's ill favor. Many have suggested that this was accomplished through dishonorable means. Two years ago, Manitore Nocta was granted the title of Warden of the Seas, taking the title away from the Solei Family. Since then, House Solei has been investigating House Nocta for connections to organized crime and corruption.</li>
					<li>House Goddard of the Foothills is constantly under pressure. The Crown keeps applying political pressure to expand the Kingdom's territory, while the Kingdom of Wind keeps applying military pressure from the South. The people of the Foothills do not feel like a part of the Realm. They have their own culture and there are whispers about secession or even revolution.</li>
				<ul>

	<h2>Religion</h2>
	<div class="block">
		<div class="th">The Burning Wheel</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p>The Burning Wheel is the official religion of Solaris, and the major religion to the East of the Spine of the World. The religion began on the island of Solei at the start of the Age of Flames. The religion preaches that there are two Gods: Solas, the God of the Sun, and Nox, the Goddess of the Moon. The religion claims that Solas created Man and serves as a preserving influence over them, while Nox is a corrupting influence and wants humanity to destroy itself.</p>
			<p>The religion's primary tenants are:
				<ul>
					<li>Solas, God of the Sun, Lord of Truth, and the Burning Wheel, created Humanity to rule over the world in His Name.</li>
					<li>Nox, Goddess of the Moon, Speaker of Lies, and the Lady of One Thousand Faces, is the enemy of Solas and Humanity, and she works endlessly to make Humanity destroy itself through corruption.</li>
					<li>Live with honor in the Name of the Burning Wheel. Do naught that would tarnish your name, your Family's name, or His Name.</li>
					<li>To walk with Nox is to be destroyed. Be not tempted by simple answers through dishonesty, for that way lies only disaster.</li>
					<li>There is no greater insult to the Burning Wheel than to perform treachery or dishonesty under his watchful eye. The Day is a time for truth and honor.</li> 
					<li>The followers of the Burning Wheel have a divine mandate to spread His Word across Land and Ocean to ensure Nox gains no foothold in this world.</li>
				</ul>
				These tenants are drawn from the religion's primary holy work, "To Walk the Path," written by the First Prophet Tessin Solei at the start of the Age of Fire.</p>
				<p>The religion is fairly direct and simple. However, certain complications have arose due to them. For instance, the "Divine Mandate to Spread His Word" caused the Island of Solei to begin spreading its influence and conquer everything in its path. Many Septons believe that silver is where the first beams of moonlight touched iron, and claim it is corrupted by Nox. Because of this, silver is worthless in any city with a strong Burning Wheel contingent. </p>

	<div class="block">
		<div class="th">The White Tree</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p>The White Tree is a pantheon of Gods followed by the Kingdom of Sand and Stone. The religion describes their Gods as Fae beings who are alien and indifferent to the plights of men. They supposedly are each bound to a certain facet of reality, and deals can be made with them for changes over the facet they control. There are no septons or any organization to the White Tree; the religious leadership is instead left to the head of the household.</p>
			<p>The religion has only one tenant: A deal that has been made must not be broken. This applies to dealings with the Gods and with your fellow man. In addition, most followers of the White Tree tend to align themselves with one or two Gods and try to live their life according to principles similar to them. Despite the claim that humans can make deals with the Gods and stories of it happening, no one has been able to summon one of the Gods in living memory.</p>

	<div class="block">
		<div class="th">The Silver Wheel</div>
		<div class="description">
			<p>The Silver Wheel is not a traditional religion, but rather it is something of a negation of the Burning Wheel. The Silver Wheel refers to the Moon Goddess Nox, who the followers of the Silver Wheel draw wisdom and insight from. The religion has no true structure, no places of worship, and no tenants, but nonetheless there are several believers, especially among thieves and spies. Unlike those trying to gain favor from Solas, Nox often shows signs that she is watching her followers. She is the patron of lies and deception, and works to make the world a more interesting place.</p>
			<p>As expected, the Burning Wheel does not tolerate the worship of Nox, and the High Septon created an inquisition at the beginning of the Age of Peace to root out all members of the Silver Wheel. They have managed to find several communities organized around the moon goddess, but have been unsuccessful overall.</p>
